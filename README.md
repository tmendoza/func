## What is it?

Func is a remote execution tool developed by some [folks](https://fedorahosted.org/func/) at Redhat several years ago.  The last commit
to the git repository over at RedHat was well over 2-3 years ago.  I have created my own personal clone of that repo to make sure I have
it going forward.  Who knows, RedHat may purge this project at some point in the future.

## Why keep using it?

Well I think the original func website said it best:

* Have you ever tried to command or query a large number of systems with SSH? Have you wanted a better way?
* Have you wanted a way to audit all of your remote commands on all of your systems?
* Tired of writing shell scripts and parsing command output?
* Are you fed up with CIM, WBEM, and complicated communication systems that prevent you from doing /real/ work?
* Well have we got a solution for you. It's Func.
